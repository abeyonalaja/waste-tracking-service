# Receipt of Waste - data requirements

!!! Note "Private Beta"
    Are you a waste receiver or software provider and want to get involved? [Sign up for our Digital Waste Tracking Private Beta test](private-beta-comms-sign-up.md)

These draft data definition tables describe the information we expect to be recorded by the future waste tracking service when a receiving site accepts or rejects waste.

They are a draft and may be updated to reflect changes to policy, legislation and feedback received from those in the waste industry.
